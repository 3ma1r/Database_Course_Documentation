## 1. Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

| Feature           | Flat File System                                                                 | Relational Database                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**      | Stores data in plain text or CSV files with no enforced schema                 | Organizes data into tables with defined schemas and relationships                   |
| **Data Redundancy**| High redundancy due to repeated information across files                        | Low redundancy due to normalization and table relationships                         |
| **Relationships**  | No built-in support for relationships                                            | Supports one-to-many and many-to-many relationships via keys                        |
| **Example Usage**  | Contact lists, log files, CSV exports                                           | Banking systems, online stores, business management apps                            |
| **Drawbacks**      | Difficult to manage, high risk of inconsistency, poor scalability               | Requires setup and learning, can be complex for simple use cases                    |
